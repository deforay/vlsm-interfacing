/**
 * Asks, once in a while, whether a newer version has been published.

 * WHY the main process: outbound requests belong here, with the rest of them,
 * and Electron's net stack follows the machine's proxy configuration. A
 * laboratory that reaches the internet through a proxy is common; one that has
 * taught a renderer's fetch about it is not.
 *
 * This asks and reports. It does not download anything, does not run anything,
 * and cannot be told which page to open: the releases page is a constant here,
 * so a renderer can ask for it to be opened but not choose what "it" is.
