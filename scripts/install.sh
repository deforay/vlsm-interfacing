# running the version it had.
#
# WHY the status as well as the version: a package can be unpacked and then
# fail to configure. dpkg reports the new version for it either way, so the

# is the state a laboratory is least able to diagnose and most likely to be

# Takes the machine off the package the tool shipped under before the rename.
#
# WHY this is needed at all: dpkg identifies a package by name, and the new
# name is a different package as far as it is concerned. Installing alongside
# the old one would leave both -- two entries in the applications menu, two
# copies in /opt, and an operator who cannot tell which one they just opened.
#
# WHY it is not simply done first: a laboratory that ends an upgrade with no
# application at all is worse off than one that never started it. apt can
# remove the old package and install the new one as a single transaction, and
# a failure part way through leaves the working application in place. That is
# the path taken whenever apt is available, which on Debian and Ubuntu is
# always. The fallback below only removes the old package once the new one has
# proved it cannot install any other way.
#
# The laboratory's data is untouched either way. Settings, the database and the
# backups live under the user's configuration directory, which the package
# manager neither owns nor removes -- and which the application names for
# itself precisely so a rename cannot move it.
