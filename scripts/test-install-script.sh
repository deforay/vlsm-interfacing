# Drives scripts/install.sh against stand-ins for curl, apt-get and dpkg.

# WHY: this script is what every Debian and Ubuntu laboratory runs, on a
# machine that is already working, and its failure modes are the expensive
# kind -- an upgrade that removes the application it was replacing, or one that
# says "Installation completed" while the laboratory carries on running the
# version it had and nobody finds out until a result goes missing.
#
# Neither is visible by reading it. Both are one stubbed command away from
# being demonstrated.
#
# Nothing here runs in a subshell. An earlier version put each case in one, so
# a failed assertion incremented a copy of the count and the script exited 0
# with FAILED printed above it: a test that reports and does not fail is worse
# than no test, because the build stays green and someone has read the word
# "test" and stopped worrying.
