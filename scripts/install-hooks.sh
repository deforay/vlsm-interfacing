# Install repo git hooks by symlinking .git/hooks/<name> -> scripts/hooks/<name>.
# Run once per clone:  npm run install-hooks
#
# Best-effort by design: never fails, so it stays safe to call from an npm
# lifecycle script or a setup step where a hard failure would abort the run.
# Any problem -> warn and exit 0. A clean no-op outside a git checkout.
#
# NOTE: targets `git rev-parse --git-common-dir`/hooks -- the literal repo hooks
# directory -- NOT `--git-path hooks`, which honours core.hooksPath and would
# write into a globally configured hooks directory instead of this repo's.
#
# A global core.hooksPath does not stop these from running, provided the global
# dispatcher delegates to the repo-local hook of the same name. If yours does
# not, it will shadow these; point core.hooksPath at this directory instead.
