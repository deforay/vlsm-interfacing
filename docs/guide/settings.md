# Settings

The Settings page is organised into sections down the left-hand side. Nothing
takes effect until you press **Save Settings**.

## System

| Field | What it is |
|-------|------------|
| **Testing Lab Code/ID** | A unique identifier for the laboratory, e.g. `LAB001`. It travels with every result. |
| **Testing Lab Name** | The laboratory's name, as it should appear on results. |
| **Auto-connect on startup** | `Yes` skips the login screen and connects every instrument when the application opens. `No` shows the login screen and leaves connecting to you. |

The **SQLite Database Path** is shown rather than asked for: it is where results
are stored on this machine, and the tool decides it.

## MySQL *(optional)*

Configure this if your LIS reads results from MySQL.

| Field | What it is |
|-------|------------|
| **MySQL Host** | Database server address, e.g. `127.0.0.1` |
| **MySQL Port** | Default `3306` |
| **Database Name** | e.g. `interfacing` |
| **Database User** | MySQL username |
| **Database Password** | MySQL password |

**Test Connection** proves the database is reachable before you save a
configuration that depends on it.

!!! info "MySQL is optional"

    Without it, results are still stored locally in SQLite. What you lose is the
    shared table an LIS on another machine can read.

## Instruments

**+ Add Instrument** for each analyzer this tool will talk to.

### Connection

| Field | What it is |
|-------|------------|
| **Connection Mode** | `TCP Server` — the analyzer connects to this tool. `TCP Client` — this tool connects to the analyzer. The analyzer's own configuration decides which one you need. |
| **Communication Protocol** | `ASTM`, `ASTM (with checksum)`, or `HL7`. |
| **IP Address** | In server mode, the address on this machine to listen on. In client mode, the analyzer's address. |
| **Port Number** | 1–65535, matching what the analyzer is configured for. |

!!! warning "Checksum or not is the analyzer's decision, not a preference"

    An analyzer configured to send checksums and a tool configured not to expect
    them will still appear to work, and will still store results. What is lost is
    the check that a frame arrived intact, and the ability to ask for it again
    when it did not. Set this to what the analyzer is actually doing. If you are
    unsure, [the console log](console.md#connection-logs) shows which one it is
    reading.

### The instrument itself

| Field | What it is |
|-------|------------|
| **Analyzer Type** | The model. Roche cobas Taqman, 4800, 5800, 6800/8800; Abbott m2000, Alinity m; Cepheid GeneXpert; or one of the generic ASTM and HL7 choices. |
| **Instrument Name/Code** | The name the LIS knows this analyzer by. It is what results are mapped by, so it has to match what the LIS expects. |
| **Display Order** | The order the instruments appear in on the console. |

Each instrument needs a unique name and a unique address-and-port combination.

!!! tip "Why the analyzer type matters"

    Two analyzers can both speak ASTM and still disagree about where the sample
    identifier lives or what an empty result field means. The analyzer type is
    how the tool knows which of those dialects it is listening to. Choosing
    "Other" for a model that is in the list will store results, but some fields
    may come through empty.

## LIS API *(optional)*

If your LIS offers an API, the tool can fetch the instrument names it expects,
so the names on both sides match.

| Field | What it is |
|-------|------------|
| **Base URL** | e.g. `https://lis.example.org` |
| **Auth Type** | `None`, `Bearer Token`, `Basic Auth`, or `API Key` |
| **Fetch Instruments Endpoint** | e.g. `/api/v1.1/instruments?labId=XYZ` |

**Fetch Instruments** tests the connection and retrieves the names. You can
always type them by hand instead.

## Connecting to InteLIS

If your laboratory uses InteLIS, the **Connection Code** from your facility page
configures the laboratory, its instruments and the credentials in one step,
rather than filling in the sections above. Codes are single-use and expire.
