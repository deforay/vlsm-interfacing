# Protocols on the wire

Two protocols, and the parts of them that cause trouble in the field.

## ASTM: E1381 framing, E1394 records

**E1394** defines the records: `H` header, `P` patient, `O` order, `R` result,
`C` comment, `L` terminator, fields separated by `|`, components by `^`, each
record ending in CR.

**E1381** defines how those records cross a serial line or a socket:

```
<ENQ>                                    the analyzer asks to send
                                  <ACK>  the tool agrees
<STX> 1 <records> <ETX> cc <CR><LF>      a frame, ETX = last of the message
                                  <ACK>  acknowledged
<EOT>                                    the analyzer is done
```

Frame numbers run 1–7 then 0, restarting for each message. `cc` is the checksum:
the modulo-256 sum of every byte after `<STX>` up to and including the
terminator, as two uppercase hex digits.

### Records get cut wherever the frame ends

This is the single most consequential fact about ASTM in practice. A frame holds
a bounded number of bytes — the GeneXpert fills 240 — and a record longer than
what is left is **cut wherever that falls, mid-field, mid-word**. The frame ends
in `<ETB>` instead of `<ETX>`, and the record continues at the start of the next
one:

```
R|1|^^^HIV-1^Xpert HIV-1 Viral Load XC^3^^|DÉTECTÉ^|co<ETB>E4<CR><LF>
<STX>2pies/mL|40,00 to 10000000,00|<||F||...
```

`co` + `pies/mL` is `copies/mL`. Rejoining across `<ETB>cc<CR><LF><STX>n` has to
happen **before** the stream is split into records. Get it wrong and the result
either keeps the frame's checksum inside it — `co<ETB>E4` stored as a unit — or
loses every field after the cut, which is how a laboratory ends up with 97 of
136 results stored empty and synced to their LIS that way.

### Checksum mode and non-checksum mode

Both are in the field, because both are settings on the analyzers.

- **With checksums**, each frame is verified and a frame that fails is `NAK`ed
  so the analyzer sends it again.
- **Without**, there is nothing to verify; every chunk is accepted as it comes.

The tool has to be told which, because a frame's trailing two characters are
either a checksum to strip or two characters of data.

### A retransmitted frame is not a second record

If the analyzer's `<ACK>` does not arrive it sends the same frame again — same
frame number, since a new frame always advances. Appending it twice duplicates
its records, and a duplicated `O` record becomes a second order with no `R`
records behind it: a result saved as a failure against a sample that in fact has
a result, sitting next to the true one, both queued for the LIS.

A frame carrying the number of the one before it is acknowledged and dropped.
It is deliberately kept out of the stored transmission too: framing is gone by
the time raw data is read back, so a second copy of a record in there cannot be
told from a second order, and re-processing would write exactly the row the
check prevents.

## HL7 v2 over MLLP

An HL7 message is wrapped in a **minimal lower layer protocol** block:

```
<VT> MSH|^~\&|... <FS> <CR>
```

`<VT>` (0x0B) opens, `<FS>` (0x1C) closes, `<CR>` terminates. The tool answers
with an `ACK` echoing the message control ID, HL7 version and character set.

Two tolerances matter, because analyzers in the field need both:

- **The `<VT>` may be missing.** Some analyzers just start with `MSH`.
- **The `<CR>` may be missing, or late.** TCP splits wherever it likes, so a
  block can end one chunk at `<FS>` and have its `<CR>` arrive in the next.

A block is therefore complete at `<FS>`, but held briefly for a `<CR>` that may
still be coming, so the transmission stored is the one that was sent rather than
one byte short of it. When no `<CR>` follows, or the connection goes away first,
the block is taken as it stands — an analyzer that never sends a terminator has
still finished sending a result, and waiting for a byte it will not send would
lose it.

## What both have in common

**The raw transmission is stored before it is understood.** Framing, records and
all. It is what makes a bad parse recoverable: when a defect is found and fixed,
re-processing the stored transmissions re-derives the results, and nothing has
to be asked of the analyzer again. It is also the only evidence available when a
laboratory reports a result that looks wrong.
